# Industrial Specification: Automated Food Sterilization Tunnel

> **Original Source:** [View Live Version](https://cnfx.com/llms/industry/food-manufacturing/product/automated-food-sterilization-tunnel.md)

## 1. Technical Definition
A continuous-motion thermal processing system designed for commercial sterilization of packaged food products. Utilizes a multi-stage heating, holding, and cooling cycle to ensure shelf-stability while preserving nutritional integrity.

## 2. Key Technical Parameters
| Parameter | Industrial Range | Unit | Verification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Operating Temp | 115.0 - 135.0 | °C | RTD Pt100 Calibrated |
| Steam Pressure | 2.5 - 4.0 | bar | Transducer Linked |
| Throughput | 500 | units/min | Counter Logic |

## 3. Core System Components (BOM)
- **Primary Heating Zone**: 4-zone steam injection manifold.
- **Cooling Module**: Counter-current water heat exchanger.
- **Conveyor System**: Intralox modular high-temp belt.
- **Sensors**: Dual-redundant temperature and pressure arrays.

## 4. Engineering Risks & FMEA
- **Critical Control Point (CCP)**: Temperature must not drop below 121.1°C for 15 mins for low-acid canned foods.
- **Failure Mode**: Steam valve stiction leading to over-pressure. 
- **Mitigation**: Automated emergency venting and redundant mechanical safety valves.

## 5. FAQ
### Q: Can this handle flexible retort pouches?
**A**: Yes, the system features **Active Overpressure Control** specifically to prevent seal failure in flexible packaging during the transition from heating to cooling.
